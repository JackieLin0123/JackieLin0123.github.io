<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello! I'm **Jackie Lin (zh: 林觉凯)**, an undergraduate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, majoring in Software Engineering with a focus on Machine Intelligence. My research interests lie in **multimodal large language models, spatial intelligence and reasoning models, and medical AI models**.

Over the past one and a half years, I have been actively engaged in research at the **MAIL of Tongji University and East China Normal University**. I have had the privilege to be advised by [Assoc. Prof. Bo Jin](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1063/2768.htm) and [Asst. Prof. Wenhao Li](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1121/3280.htm), and to collaborate closely with senior colleague **Yunyang Cao**. I am deeply grateful for their guidance and support, which have greatly enriched my undergraduate research experience and helped me build a solid foundation for pursuing advanced studies in AI.  

During my undergraduate studies, I achieved a **comprehensive ranking** of 9/197 (top 5%), which qualified me for postgraduate recommendation. I am expected to pursue my **Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence** at the **Digital Media Computing & Design Lab (DCD Lab), Zhejiang University**, under the supervision of [Researcher Wenqiao Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wenqiao) (ZJU Hundred Talents Program).
